description: >
    Gracefully shuts down and deletes a running VM, sending the ACPI signal.
    Once the VM is shutdown, the host is cleaned and persistent and deferred-snapshot disks
    will be moved to the associated datastore.
    If after a given time the VM is still running (e.g. guest ignoring ACPI signals),
    OpenNebula will return the VM to the RUNNING state
